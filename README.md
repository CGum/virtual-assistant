This is a virtual assistant just like Siri and Alexa. 

Depending on the user voice command, the assistant will perform a certain task. The word/words inside of " " must be used as they are key words for the virtual assistant to perform the task you are asking for. The current iteration of the virtual assistant supports the following commands:

• Ask for "current date"   

• Ask for "current time"   

• Ask to "search" or "search for" anything <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "Search" - then you have to say what you want to search right after it ex. Search dogs <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "Search for" - as long as those two words are present in the sentence, anything said after "for" will be searched ex. Search all over the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;internet for dogs

• Ask to "find location" <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- a location will be found using Google Maps ex. Find location Los Angeles California

• Ask the assistants what's "your name?"

• Ask to "Exit" 
    - to stop the program and exit
